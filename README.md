# MICA Capstone Project

This was a labour of love. An analysis of spatial equity among the cycling community in NYC's 5 boroughs (Queens, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Bronx and Staten Island). 

This project was delivered as part of completion of the MPS Data Visualization and Analytics at the **Maryland Institute College of the Arts** beter known as MICA. 

Although I've met the requirements for completion (The project received a grade A) I am continuing to work on this project. The intended next steps is a public visual installation. 

## The Technical Stuff

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First install Node.Js and NPM on your machine, then navigate to the directory `biking-safety` and run `npm install`.

Then for runing the website please run the command `npm run dev`. 

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
